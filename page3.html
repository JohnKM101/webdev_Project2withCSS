    <h1>Photography</h1>
    <p>
      I like to take pictures everywhere I go,  I enjoy capturing nature, urban landscapes, and portraits. 
      Photography allows me to capture memories because I have poor memory. Photography is one of my favorite hobbies.
      One of my favorite pastimes is photography. I like to photograph unscripted moments, urban landscapes, and the beauty of nature. 
      It enables me to use timing, composition, and lighting to express my creativity.
